Here is the final updated code:
```python
def table_of_four():
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f"4 * {i} = {4 * i}")

table_of_four()
```
Note: The instruction to "push changes to GitHub repository named login-website" is not a part of the Python code, it's a separate task that involves using Git version control system to commit and push changes to a GitHub repository. The above code only creates a function to print a table of 4.
